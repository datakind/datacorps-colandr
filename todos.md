- general comments
    - there's *a lot* of whitespace and excess padding throughout the app, particularly in the vertical direction
        - [x] global nav bar should be thinner
        - [x] all screen titles should have less padding between global nav bar and their "underlines"
        - [x] gray background rectangles denoting certain clickable regions, logical groups, or headers should be lighter in color
        - [x] "back" icon to left of all screen titles should be a single left chevron, not double triangles
- global nav
    - [x] lowercase "Colandr" text in upper left
    - [x] add icon of a colander to far upper left
    - [x] both text and icon should be clickable, sending user back to "home" screen
    - [x] add current user's username in upper right, make it a dropdown button with options: user (account) settings, sign out
    - [x] when user has clicked into a particular review, replace "colandr" text with the title of the review; if title is too long for the nav bar, cut it off with an ellipsis (this makes sense, right?)
- ADD user (account) settings page
    - add / update profile information: full name, institutional affiliation (NEEDS BACK-END WORK!)
    - change email, password
    - delete account
- "my reviews" screen
    - [x] collaborators' usernames should be shown below review title (and, in the future, *clickable* to go to a user profile page)
    - [x] title should be left-aligned, with less padding all around
    - [x] remove settings gear icon
    - [x] date created font size should be slightly larger
    - [x] "new review" button should say "create review" â€” better to use clear action words
- review overview screen
    - [x] new screen title: "review progress"
    - [x] move "import" button from citation screening card to above the screen title line
    - [x] add "export" button above the screen title line, alongside import and settings buttons; it will go to a dedicated screen for exporting review data
- review settings screen (TODO: MOCK THIS UP)
    - add local nav side-bar with items: "basic info", "team", and "status", and split associated content across each of these sub-screens
    - basic info sub-screen should have a "save" button; if user clicks away without saving, changes are lost (this makes sense, right?)
